# Minerva Archer - Personal Site

After building my own site from scratch in 2015 and basically ignoring it, I decided it was time for a redesign using more recent technologies and better conventions. You can view the code for the old site [here](https://github.com/MinervaArcher/minervaarcher).

The current site uses Vue for templating & rendering, Vue Router for routing and dynamic link updates, and module-specific CSS.

## TODO
- ~Clear out unused fonts once final decisions are made~
- Add Storybook stories for each component
- Write unit tests
- ~Add Lighthouse tracking~
- Refine image srcset sizes
- ~Fully test accessibility features~
- Enable service workers
- ~Favicon~
- Convert from vue-cli over to pure webpack config
- ~Lazy-load images in portfolio pages~
